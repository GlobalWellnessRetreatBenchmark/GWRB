# Global Retreat Wellness Benchmark (GRWB)

**Version:** v.1 • **Effective:** 21 Aug 2025  
**Scope:** Mental wellbeing and mental health retreats, clinics, and 1:1 facilitation (psychedelic services only where lawful).

GRWB is an open benchmark that makes safety and responsibility **visible and comparable**. Operators share evidence in private; the public sees a clean Safety & Quality Profile with five badges and, when guardrails pass, a composite score.

- **At-a-glance Overview**: [`/docs/overview.md`](docs/overview.md)  
- **Profile schema (JSON)**: [`/spec/schema.json`](spec/schema.json)  
- **Changelog**: [`/CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)

## Public badges (0–3 each)
Screening • Facilitators • Medical Coverage • Acute Safety • Integration

Behind the scenes: Legal & Governance, Ethics & Safeguarding, Protocol & Dosing (lawful contexts), Outcomes & Monitoring (optional, non-diagnostic).

## Composite (0–100)
Let A be applicable dimensions with weights Wi and scores Si (0–100). Normalize Wi’ = Wi / ΣWj for j∈A.  
**Composite = round( Σ( Si × Wi’ ) )**, .5 rounds up. Guardrails must pass before showing it.
