# Contributing to GRWB

We welcome issues and pull requests that improve clarity, evidence, and safety.

## Ground rules
- Use clear, testable language. When proposing **Musts** or **Signals**, explain the rationale and (if possible) cite sources.
- Breaking changes to Musts should be rare and clearly justified.
- Keep examples non-endorsements.

## Process
1. Open an Issue describing the problem or proposal.
2. Submit a PR referencing the Issue, with a brief impact assessment.
3. A reviewer will request changes or approve.

By contributing, you agree to:
- License your contribution under **CC BY-NC 4.0** for the public spec.
- Grant the GRWB Steering a **perpetual, worldwide commercial license** to your contribution so GRWB-aligned services/products can implement it (see `CLA.md`).

Be kind. Follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
