## Executive Summary
The Global Retreat Wellness Benchmark (GRWB) is a defensible, repeatable framework that verifies how operators protect participant safety and uphold respect. The benchmark allows for a private review of an operator's evidence, resulting in a concise, public-facing Profile for each verified listing. This Profile includes five public badges and a composite score for high-level comparison. The benchmark spans both psychedelic (where lawful) and non-psychedelic modalities and centers on the principles of privacy, informed consent, and harm minimization.

**Public Badges:** Screening • Facilitators • Medical Coverage • Acute Safety • Integration  
**Behind-the-Scenes Checks:** Legal & Governance, Ethics & Safeguarding, Protocol & Dosing (where applicable), Outcomes & Monitoring.

## 1. Purpose and Scope
- Provide a repeatable, transparent method to evaluate operator safety and ethical practices.  
- Give seekers clear, trustworthy signals without exposing operators' sensitive internal documents.  
- Support regulators, researchers, and partners with a standardized, open-source framework.  
- Cover both psychedelic and a wide range of non-psychedelic wellness modalities.  
- Keep data protection and participant dignity at the center of all evaluations.

## 2. Principles
- **Legality First:** If a service is not lawful in its operating jurisdiction, it cannot be benchmarked or listed.  
- **Non-Invasive Verification:** Operators share evidence privately; public listings show a summarized, standardized Profile.  
- **Harm Minimization:** Mandates clear contraindications, robust informed consent processes, and established pathways for de-escalation and aftercare.  
- **Privacy by Design:** Special-category data is processed only with explicit consent and clear, accessible opt-in/opt-out mechanisms.  
- **No Clinical Claims:** Wearable-based insights are presented as wellbeing signals, not diagnostics.  
- **Versioned Transparency:** Each public Profile displays the benchmark version it was evaluated against and the date of the last review.

## 3. Key Definitions
- **Operator:** The legal entity or individual primarily responsible for a program.  
- **Program:** A specific retreat, clinic pathway, or 1:1 protocol being evaluated.  
- **Facilitator:** A person who delivers or directly supervises the core intervention.  
- **Profile:** The public-facing summary, including five badges (rated 0–3 dots each) and a composite score.  
- **Musts:** The minimum, non-negotiable requirements to receive a badge.  
- **Signals:** Practices that strengthen safety and quality beyond the minimum requirements.  
- **Special-category data:** Health or biometric data that requires explicit consent for processing. This also includes information on contraindications that explicitly deter use of a specific modality.  
- **Reportable Incident:** Any event that results in or poses a risk of significant harm and requires action. Examples include a serious adverse event needing external care, a credible boundary/ethical allegation, a missing person, a substance-related error (where relevant), an evacuation-level hazard, a suspected data breach impacting safety or privacy, a suicide attempt, or a death.

## 4. What the Public Sees on a Listing
**Badges:** Screening • Facilitators • Medical Coverage • Acute Safety • Integration (each rated 0–3 dots).

**Levels:**
- **Not Met:** The operator fails to meet minimum requirements. The listing is hidden or blocked from publication.  
- **Basic (●):** All "Musts" for the badge are met.  
- **Strong (●●):** All "Musts" are met, plus at least two "Signals."  
- **Exemplary (●●●):** All "Musts" are met, plus at least four "Signals" and at least one form of external assurance (e.g., an external advisory audit).

**Composite Score:** A 0–100 score for high-level comparison. The badges and accompanying notes remain the primary tool for detailed decision-making.

**Filters:** Modality, legal status, duration, group size, languages, dietary options, LGBTQ+ inclusive policies, gender policies, medical coverage level, integration depth, physical accessibility features, sensory accommodations, cultural/language support, transparent pricing, and fair refund policies.

### 4.1 Composite Score (0–100)
**How Calculated:**
- Each of the nine dimensions (see Section 5) is scored from 0–100 based on the rubrics provided.  
- Weights are applied to compute a weighted average: Legal & Governance (12), Screening (14), Facilitators (14), Medical Coverage (14), Acute Safety (12), Protocol & Dosing (12), Ethics & Safeguarding (12), Integration (6), Outcomes & Monitoring (4).  
- If a dimension is not applicable (e.g., Protocol & Dosing in non-psychedelic settings), its weight is redistributed proportionally across the remaining applicable dimensions.  
- The final score is rounded to the nearest whole number (0.5 rounds up).

**Guardrails:**
- A failure in Legal & Governance prevents the publication of a listing and score.  
- A "Not Met" rating in Screening, Facilitators, Medical Coverage, or Acute Safety places the listing on hold until the issues are resolved.  
- Composite scores are intended to be directional; the nuanced details are found in the badges and operator notes.

## 5. Operator Assessment Dimensions

### 5.1 Legal & Governance (Internal Gatekeeper) — Weight 12
**Musts:** Verifiable legal entity and responsible person; service is lawful for the jurisdiction; no illegal advertising or unsubstantiated claims.  
**Signals:** Adequate insurance; venue permits and compliance records; checks for local restrictions; completion of an annual external advisory audit (scope in Section 13); robust financial safeguarding (transparent pricing, clear and fair cancellation/refund policy, no pressure selling, all fees and taxes disclosed).  
**Evidence:** Entity documents, licenses, insurance certificates, locality confirmations, pricing and refund policies, audit attestations.  
**Scoring:** Missing any Must → 0. All Musts → base 60; +10 per Signal (capped at +40); +10 for external assurance; max 100. A score of 0 on this dimension prevents listing publication.

### 5.2 Screening & Contraindications (Public: Screening) — Weight 14
**Musts:** A written pre-screening process that captures medical conditions, medications, and relevant personal history; clear, modality-specific exclusion criteria; a plain-language informed consent document. **Pregnancy** is required as a distinct screening category due to its unique physiological state, potential risks to the fetus, and complex ethical considerations that differentiate it from general medical conditions.  
**Signals:** Clinician review for complex cases (by a licensed psychologist/physician); a mandatory triage call before any financial deposit is taken; established referral pathways for individuals who are not a good fit.  
**Evidence:** Blank/redacted screening and consent templates; exclusion policy; escalation Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).  
**Scoring:** As above.

### 5.3 Facilitator Credentials & Supervision (Public: Facilitators) — Weight 14
**Musts:** Verifiable, modality-relevant training; a defined minimum experience policy; a signed ethics and boundaries policy for all staff.  
**What counts as verifiable training (baseline):** A defined curriculum with learning outcomes; supervised contact hours with observed practice and feedback; formal assessment of competence before independent work; current first aid/CPR and safeguarding/boundaries training; a clear cycle of ongoing supervision/peer review and re-certification.  
**Examples (non-exhaustive):** Regulated clinical licenses (e.g., psychology, medicine); university-affiliated certificates with practicums; established training schools with significant contact hours (e.g., ≥200 for yoga) and supervised practice; somatic programs that document supervised sessions and instructor evaluations.  
**Signals:** A formal program for ongoing supervision; mandatory background checks/references; continuing education tracking; training in identity-inclusive practices, racial/cultural competency, neurodiversity, and accessibility.  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above.

### 5.4 Medical Coverage & On-Site Risk Management (Public: Medical Coverage) — Weight 14
**Musts:** A written emergency plan (defining roles, escalation steps, local contacts); a well-stocked first-aid kit and valid first-aid/CPR certificates for relevant staff; nearest clinic/hospital documented with a viable transport plan.  
**Signals:** An on-site or on-call licensed medical professional (MD, RN, Paramedic); a formal incident reporting template and log; a lawful substance testing policy where relevant.  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above. The presence of a licensed medical professional is a strong positive signal.

### 5.5 Acute Safety, Environment & Triggers (Public: Acute Safety) — Weight 12
**Musts:** Declared participant-to-facilitator ratios for all activities; a venue safety checklist (fire safety, exits, sleeping arrangements, gender safety, LGBTQ+ inclusion, night coverage); a clear boundaries and touch policy.  
**Recommended minimum ratios:** Vary by modality (e.g., 1:5 for peak psychedelic sessions, 1:8 for breathwork, 1:12 for yoga). Ratios must be reduced (more staff) for higher-risk participants, complex venues, or adverse conditions.  
**Signals:** Gender-balanced teams and separate night staff; secure storage for personal valuables and sensitive materials; formal briefing/debriefing scripts; trigger-aware setting controls (e.g., policies for music, lighting, scent; availability of comfort items; participant control over their environment within safety bounds); documented neurodiversity and sensory accommodations (e.g., low-stimulation spaces, predictable schedules, visual aids).  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above.

### 5.6 Protocol & Dosing (Internal, Psychedelic-Legal Only) — Weight 12
**Musts:** Substance policy is fully aligned with local law and product regulations; a set and setting protocol with continuous observation; guidance on food/medication interactions and defined post-dose observation windows.  
**Signals:** Documented criteria for titration and deviation from standard protocol; availability of low-dose options for sensitive cases; a specific plan for managing environmental triggers during sessions.  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above.

### 5.7 Ethics & Safeguarding (Internal) — Weight 12
**Musts:** An anti-harassment and safeguarding policy; safe, clearly communicated complaint channels; a formal consent procedure for any form of physical touch.  
**Signals:** An independent ombudsperson or third-party ethics officer; a publicly available code of ethics; staff training logs; LGBTQ+ inclusion policies and training; robust financial safeguarding; a cultural competency policy with periodic training; a formal accessibility plan (physical, sensory, and linguistic).  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above.

### 5.8 Integration & Aftercare (Public: Integration) — Weight 6
**Musts:** A minimum of one structured integration session post-experience; a curated referral directory for further support; a crisis-response plan with clear timelines.  
**Signals:** Programmed 30- and 90-day follow-ups; provision of structured tools (e.g., journals, apps); use of simple self-report scales to track wellbeing.  
**Evidence/Scoring:** As above.

### 5.9 Outcomes, Monitoring & Participant Feedback (Optional Public Badge) — Weight 4
**Musts:** Explicit opt-in for any data collection; use of defined, non-diagnostic measures; commitment to de-identified data aggregation only.  
**Signals:**  
- **Systematic Participant Feedback Loop:** Use of an anonymized post-retreat survey administered by a neutral third party or via a method that prevents staff access to identifiable responses. Aggregate results and response rates are shared during renewal, along with a "lessons learned" summary.  
- High completion rates for pre- and post-program assessments (e.g., T-7, T+7, T+30); use of mixed methods (e.g., self-report plus wearable signals).  
**Evidence:** Survey instruments, process descriptions, proof of third-party administration, recent aggregate outputs and response rates.  
**Scoring:** This dimension can be marked "Not Applicable," with weights re-normalized accordingly.

## 6. Modality Overlays
This benchmark recognizes that different modalities carry unique risks and require specific safeguards.

**Psychedelic Contexts:**  
*Exclusions:* e.g., history of psychosis, bipolar I, uncontrolled epilepsy, serious cardiac disease, pregnancy, certain medication conflicts.  
*Safeguards:* Strict sitter ratios, continuous observation, post-session accompaniment, clear transport policies, trigger-aware environment planning.

**Intense Breathwork:**  
*Exclusions:* e.g., seizure history, pregnancy, uncontrolled hypertension, high arrhythmia risk.  
*Safeguards:* Non-coercive facilitation, clear stop signals, and re-oxygenation protocols.

**Meditation & Silent Retreats:**  
*Known Challenges:* Anxiety spikes, trauma resurfacing, manic symptoms in susceptible individuals.  
*Safeguards:* Daily teacher check-ins, flexible participation rules, availability of grounding practices.

**Yoga, Somatic Work & Cold Exposure:**  
*Known Challenges:* Physical injury, blood pressure issues, risks associated with cold immersion.  
*Safeguards:* Clear instructions for modifications, consent-based touch, gradual progression, buddy systems for cold immersion.

**Lower-Intensity Modalities:**  
Practices such as gentle sound baths, chanting, rhythmic drumming, Qi Gong, Continuum Movement, or guided gazing generally present a lower risk profile. While all group work requires basic safety (e.g., venue safety, clear communication), the stringency of medical screening and facilitator ratios may be adjusted. However, operators must still demonstrate awareness that even low-risk modalities can be activating for some individuals and have appropriate response plans in place. All modalities are subject to the same ethical and safeguarding standards.

## 7. Seeker Pre-Screening (Guidance for Platforms)
This section provides a model for platforms using the GRWB to route seekers safely.

**Flow:**  
**Jurisdiction Filter:** Initially shows only lawful options based on user location.  
**QuickGate (~1 min):** A brief, privacy-respecting form capturing age, goals, key medical flags, medications, prior adverse experiences, and access needs.  
**Modal Overlays:** Present modality-specific questions (e.g., for psychedelic, breathwork).  

**Result Triage:**  
- **Green:** Proceed to booking request.  
- **Amber:** Requires triage by a licensed clinician. A decision and rationale are recorded, and the seeker may be routed to lower-risk options.  
- **Red:** Do not route to higher-risk modalities. Surface safer alternatives and recommend consultation with a primary care provider or therapist.

**Data Handling:** Requires explicit consent for health information; data is auto-purged after 90 days unless a booking occurs; store only flags/decisions, not full medical text, wherever possible.

## 9. Review Workflow & Incident Management
**Standard Workflow:** Submission → Completeness Check (48h) → Verification → Decision & Profile Creation → Publication → Annual Renewal.

**Incident Loop:**  
- **Intake & Triage (0–24h):** Log the report, acknowledge receipt, secure immediate risks.  
- **Containment & Notification (≤48h):** The relevant listing enters an "Under Review" status (badges greyed out).  
- **Investigation (2–14 days):** Evidence gathering and preliminary findings.  
- **Corrective & Preventive Actions (CAPA):** Operator implements required changes.  
- **Outcome & Transparency:** Listing status is updated; a summary note may be published.  
- **Re-verification:** The implemented changes are audited. Failure to resolve issues may lead to suspension or delisting.

## 10. Data Protection & Compliance
All entities conducting reviews against this benchmark must adhere to stringent data protection standards, including explicit consent for special-category data, encryption, role-based access, and lawful data handling.

---

## 11. Outcomes & Biometrics Program (Optional)
**Measures:** A balanced mix of validated self-report scales (e.g., WHO-5) and, optionally, biometric signals (e.g., HRV, sleep) from consumer wearables.  
**Cadence:** T-7, T+7, T+30 to track changes over time.  
**Consent & Language:** Must use a separate opt-in, explain the purpose in plain language, commit to de-identified aggregation, and explicitly state that it is not medical advice.

---

## 12. Publication Policy
- **Always Public:** The five badge levels, verification status, review date, composite score, and signals related to transparent pricing and accessibility.  
- **Optional (Operator Consent):** Abbreviated methods, named partners, participant feedback summaries.  
- **Never Public:** Raw screening forms, personal IDs, medical notes, internal audits.

---

## 13. Governance, Versioning & Audits
**Versioning:** The benchmark version is displayed on every public Profile.  
**Governance:** Changes to "Musts" require approval by a diverse advisory group (including an operator, a clinician, and a legal/compliance specialist).  
**Annual External Advisory Audit:** A voluntary but strongly encouraged signal involving a deeper review by an independent third party. Scope includes documentation review, staff interviews, and incident log analysis. Successful completion earns an "Audited [YYYY]" marker.  
**Appeals & Whistleblowing:** Operators have a right to appeal decisions. A confidential whistleblowing channel must be available to report concerns, which triggers the incident loop within 48 hours of a credible report.

## 14. Acknowledgements
Thank you to the clinicians, facilitators, researchers, and safety experts who contributed feedback to this and previous versions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

## 15. Public Disclaimer
This benchmark is an informational tool, not a medical provider or regulatory body. Profiles reflect documentation and checks at the time of review. They are designed to help people ask better questions and make more informed choices. They are not a substitute for medical advice and are not a guarantee of specific outcomes. Psychedelic services are benchmarked only where they are explicitly lawful.

## Appendix A — Rationale for Dimension Weights
**Highest Weight (14):** Screening, Facilitators, Medical Coverage. These dimensions have the most direct impact on preventing severe, immediate harm. Failures here have high severity and are largely controllable by the operator.  
**High Weight (12):** Legal & Governance, Acute Safety, Protocol & Dosing, Ethics & Safeguarding. These are foundational. Legal is a gatekeeper; Acute Safety controls real-time risk; Protocol is critical where applicable; and Ethics protects from boundary violations.  
**Moderate Weight (6):** Integration. Crucial for long-term wellbeing but has a lower impact on immediate life-safety compared to the acute phase.  
**Low Weight (4):** Outcomes & Monitoring. Valuable for quality improvement but is optional and not a direct safety-critical function.  
**Methodology:** Weights are determined by a matrix of (a) potential harm severity, (b) likelihood of occurrence, (c) degree of operator control, and (d) universality across modalities. This ensures that the primary public-facing badges reflect the most critical safety functions.
