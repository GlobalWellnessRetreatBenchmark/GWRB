# GRWB Overview

**Global Retreat Wellness Benchmark (GRWB)**  
**Version:** 1.0 • **Effective:** 21 Aug 2025  
**Scope:** Mental wellbeing and mental health retreats, clinics, and 1:1 facilitation. Psychedelic services are included only where lawful.

## What GRWB is
GRWB is an open-source benchmark that makes safety and responsibility visible and comparable across retreats and related services. Operators share evidence in private. The public sees a clean Profile with five badges and, when guardrails pass, a composite score. The goal: raise the floor on safety and help people choose responsibly.

**Why now**  
There are 10,000+ self-listed retreats worldwide and fewer than 400 claim “verified,” often with unclear criteria. GRWB offers transparent criteria anyone can read, discuss, and help improve.

## The five public badges (0–3 each)
- **Screening** — pre-screening, contraindications, informed consent  
- **Facilitators** — training, experience, supervision, ethics  
- **Medical Coverage** — emergency plan, first-aid/CPR, escalation and transport  
- **Acute Safety** — ratios, venue checks, boundaries/touch policy  
- **Integration** — aftercare, referrals, crisis path

Behind the scenes: **Legal & Governance**, **Ethics & Safeguarding**, **Protocol & Dosing** (lawful psychedelic contexts), **Outcomes & Monitoring** (optional, non-diagnostic).

## Composite (0–100)
Weighted average across nine dimensions (details in the spec). It’s a quick overview; the badges and notes carry the detail. If core guardrails fail, no listing is published and the composite is hidden.

## How GRWB works
1. **Review:** operator submits documents in private  
2. **Verify:** trained reviewers check minimums and signals  
3. **Publish:** show badge levels, review date, spec version, and composite (if allowed)  

**What we publish:** badge levels, verification status, review date, composite (when allowed), and select transparency signals.  
**What we never publish:** raw screening forms, personal IDs, medical notes, internal audits.

## Endorse this version
If you support the intent of **GRWB v1.0**, you can record a digital endorsement. Each endorsement is logged with name, title, affiliation (if consented), date, version, and spec hash.

> “I have reviewed GRWB v1.0. I support its use as a public benchmark to raise safety, responsibility, and transparency in wellness services. I understand this is not medical advice and applies only where lawful.”

## Governance and improvement
Open to issues and pull requests. Changes to minimums require advisory approval and are recorded in the changelog. A confidential whistleblowing channel triggers review within 48 hours of a credible report.

## Data protection
Document checks are private. Any special-category data is processed only with explicit consent. See the DPIA and Privacy Policy linked in the footer.
